        <p class="paragraph">The game was developed during the 2023 Global Game Jam. It was inspired by the cookie clicker game.
        The scope of the game is to gather nutrients to help the tree's roots grow!</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">The story behind the game</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The game was inspired by the current world affairs. As species, we need to work together. Everyone can help by a little bit to build a better world. 
        This is the reason that the game is named Build Back Better. Just as the world goes back to what it used to be, it is a good time to reflect on what we need to do make
        things better.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Development</h3><br>
        <p class="paragraph">The game was developed using the Unity game engine. I used unity due to its multiplatform support, WebGL support and total features.
        The GGJ version was build with 3 upgrades which are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="upgrade-lists"><h5>Worker upgrade</h5></li>
          <li class="upgrade-lists"><h5>Pointer upgrade</h5></li>
          <li class="upgrade-lists"><h5>Roots upgrade</h5></li>
          <p class="paragraph">These upgrades were chosen due to the jam's time constraints. As there were only 48 hours available before the end of the jam,
          I had to make decisions to ensure that the game gets developed successfuly. The graphics were made on paper and were scanned to fo the implementation purposes.
          The music was produced using Garageband on an iPad.</p>
        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">I am planning to make a full game having more upgrades, an actually story, and I might even make a controller!</p>
