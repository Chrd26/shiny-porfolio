      <p>C++ is a high-level general purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup
      </p>
      <p>as an extension to the C programming language or "C with classes".</p>
      <p>C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind
        with</p>
      <p>performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.</p>

      <h4>What is the difference?</h4>
      <p>C and C++ are pretty similar language since C++ is an extension for the C language. This is not true the case
        of
        C# which
        has similarities to the java programming language.</p>
      <h4>Here are some differences between these 3 languages:</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>C++ can run C code but the reverse is impossible.</li>
        <li>C++ is an object oriented programming language, C# is a component-oriented language, and C is a
          paradigm-free
          language.</li>
        <li>C uses functions for processing but C++ uses objects.</li>
        <li>C# cannot use pointers unlike C++ and C. C# doesn't need to manage memory and it can manage it
          automatically.</li>
        <li>C#'s syntax is more forgiving than C and C++ which makes it easier to learn than the other 2.</li>

      <header>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Variables are objects that are used to use certain type of data.</p>
      <p>To declare a variable, you must always define its type name and value. It is not needed to assign a value at
        definition. It is considered a good practice to name a variable using camelCase which helps to identify a
        variable while reading the code.
        There are multiple types of data that can be stored in a variable.</p>
      <h4>Types of Data</g4>
      <ul>
        <li>Integer data that are defined using <span class="make-bold">int</span></li>
        <li>Character data that is defined by using <span class="make-bold">char</span></li>
        <li>Floating data that is defined using <span class="make-bold">float</span></li>
        <li>Double floating data types that are defined using <span class="make-bold">double</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>How to declare a variable</h4>
      <pre>
        <code class="code-snippets">
data-type name = value<br>
<span class="make-bold">Example:</span>
int number = 5;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Variables can be used to input data for processing and store it. A variable with no value is a null variable.
        It is considered a good practice to initialize the variable which means to add value to it to avoid problems
        that may caused by an
        empty variable. For example,<span class="make-bold"> a null variable cannot be incremented by 1 since there is
          no value in it</span>. It is possible to create a variable by using the <span class="make-bold">auto</span>
        data type.
        This automates the data definition process
        and assigns the right data type to the variable. This is only possible if the variable is initialized in
        during declaration and not later.</p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <pre>
        <code>
#include &ltiostream&gt
int main()
{
auto number = 5;<br>
//This declaration and initialization
//makes use of the auto type.
//The compiler will assign automatically 
//the right data type to the variables
//which in this case is int.
}

    <section id="Conditionals" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h3>Conditionals</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Conditional statements are programming language commands used to handle decisions and the flow of the code.
        They are used to execute different blocks of code whether the defined Boolean is true or false. There are 4
        types of statements</p><br>
      <ol>
        <li class="make-bold">if statement</li>
        <p>
          These are the simplest type of conditional statement. If the condition is true, then the code block in the
          statement will run.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
if (condition)
{
std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}
}
</code>
        </pre>
        <li class="make-bold">if else statement</li><br>
        <p>This type of statement that lets the program run different blocks of code based on a certain condition.
        If the Boolean condition is true, then the code in the if's brackets is used. Otherwise, the program uses the code in the else's curly brackets.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
if (condition)
{
std::cout << "Hello\m"; 
} 
else 
{ 
std::cout <<"Hi!\n"; 
}
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <li class="make-bold">if - else if - else statement</li><br>
        <p>This is the third type of statement that uses the if keyword. This is a type of statement that uses multiple conditions. The else if statement can be used
        multiple times for a variety of conditions.</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
if (condition)
{
std::cout << "Condition 1 is true!\n";
}
else if (condition)
{
std::cout << "Condition 2 is true!\n";
}
else if (condition)
{
std::cout << "Condition 3 is true!\n";
}
else
{
std::cout << "All the conditions are false!\n";
}
}
        </code>
        </pre>
        <li class="make-bold">switch statement</li><br>
        <p>A switch statement is quite different than the if one and its variants. This is a great way if the condition has multiple values and the 
        programmer wants to implement different logic for those certain values. The syntax of the switch statement is quite different too!
        A switch contains multiple cases and a case has its very own block of code that run if the condition is met. It might also contain a <span class="make-bold">break;</span> keyword.
        The break keyword tells the switch to stop checking the rest of the cases if the condition is true. It should also have a default case which will be used if no conditions are met similarly
        to the else statement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
        <code>
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
switch condition
{
case value1:
std::cout << "Condition 1 is true!\n";
break;

case value2:
std::cout << "Condition 2 is true!\n";
break;

case value3:
std::cout << "Condition 3 is true!\n";
break;
         
case value4:
std::cout << "Condition 4 is tru!\n";
break;

default:
std::cout << "The are not any conditions that are true!\n";
break;
}
}

    <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h3>Loops</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Loops are used to run certain blocks of code multiple times. They can be used to iterate through arrays, to wait for certain inputs and apply 
      the same code multiple times! There are 3 types of loops, while, do/while and for loop.</p>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <h4><li>While Loop</li></h4>
      <p>A while loop repeats until its condition is met or can repeat forever. It can be used to make the program wait for certain inputs, repeat processes without stop or repeat 
      parts of code until the right conditions are met.</p>
      <pre><code class="code-snippets">
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
while(true)
{
std::cout << "This code loops forever!\n";
}
}

#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
while(x < 10)
{
std::cout << "This code loops until the x is bigger 10!\n";
x++
}
}

      </code></pre>
      <h4><li>Do/while loop</li></h4>
      <p>This is quite similar to a while loop. The only difference here is that it lets the code to be used by program at least once.</p>
      <pre><code class="code-snippets">
      #include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{
do
{
std::cout << "This code will run at least once!\n";
}
while(condition);
}
      </code></pre>
      <h4><li>For Loop</li></h4>
      <p>This type of loop is used if we want our code to repeat certain amount of times! A great use of it is to iterate through an array. 
      It uses the keyword <span class="make-bold">for</span> and typically is followed by a parenthesis that contains a declaration with an initialization,
      a conditional statement and an operation.</p>
      <pre><code class="code-snippets">
#include &ltiostream&gt

int main()
{

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
std::cout << "This for loop has repeated << i << " times so far!\n""; 
}
}
